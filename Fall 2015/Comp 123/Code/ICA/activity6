# first we’ll assign three variables to values
x = 25
y = 30
s = 'boolean'
# now we’ll ask questions about them
x <= y #is x less than or equal to y, True
x + 5 > y #is x+5 greater than y, False
x % 2 == 0 #is x divisble by 2, False
s > 'bodwaddle' # is the unicode value of the first character in s greater than 'b', True
len(s) == 7 #is the length of s the same as 7, True
'e' in s #is e in boolean, True
'c' in s #is c in boolean, False
'boo' in s #is 'boo' in boolean, True
